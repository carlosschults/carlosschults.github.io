<p>The 7th version of C# is coming, and it’s expected to bring some new and exciting features to our tool sets. Here’s the thing, though: Are you up to speed with its predecessor’s features?
 <!--more--></p>

<p>A few days ago I was trying to figure out what my next post would be about. It seemed only natural to write about the features of C# 7 since we’re <a href="(https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/02/09/visual-studio-2017-launch-event-and-20th-anniversary/)">one day(!!!) from the release of Visual Studio 2017.</a></p>

<p>But then I realized that, even though it’s been almost two years since the release of C# 6, some developers still aren’t comfortable with its features, and have not incorporated them into their code.</p>

<p>So, I’ve figured I’d take a step back and write about some C# 6 features instead. Not all of them, but those that can make your code cleaner and more expressive and are simple enough for you to use right away.</p>

<h2 id="string-interpolation">String Interpolation</h2>

<p>Suppose we have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> class, having <code class="highlighter-rouge">Name</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Age</code> as read-only properties. Something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/84db03cd2a530530b72c4b9eeeb738d4.js"></script>

<p>Then we have to add a method called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Introduce()</code>, to make our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> objects able to introduce themselves. For a person named “Mary” and aged 22, the method should return: “Hi! My name is Mary and I’m 22 years old.”</p>

<p>There are a few ways we could do that in C# 5, as you can see in the next listing:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/9e30324951420356397c5cc8f50ea51b.js"></script>

<p>Each one of them has their advantages and disadvantages, of course, but C# 6 offers a new way:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/17f501bd6d0ce6f5938edf17ef8e8704.js"></script>

<p>You put a dollar sign at the beginning of the string, place your variables inside curly braces - and that’s it!</p>

<p>String interpolation doesn’t work for all occasions. If you need some special formatting on the values you still have to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">string.Format</code>, for instance.</p>

<p>But on a day-to-day basis, I use interpolation most of the time when I need to concatenate strings. I find it way nicer and cleaner than the other options.</p>

<h2 id="auto-property-initializer">Auto-Property Initializer</h2>

<p>Continuing with our previous example. Let’s say that we need to provide a parameterless constructor in our class. Along with that, we need to provide default values for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Name</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Age</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Introduce</code> would return “Hi! My name is  and I’m 0 years old.” And we wouldn’t want that.</p>

<p>In C# 5, we’d have to initialize the properties inside the constructor:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/d95cade5d8d5f245a1d6bb49ef2feb1f.js"></script>

<p>C# 6 let us provide default values for our properties when we declare them:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/e7d56c032e723f7c5110a9e3bfa1c744.js"></script>

<h2 id="null-conditional-operator">Null Conditional Operator</h2>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/7fb5caff2e73f4130f4db982825adbe6.js"></script>

<p>Nothing remarkable about it. But there’s a problem waiting to happen here. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>, then this code will throw a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NullReferenceException</code>.</p>

<p>This is when the new “Null Conditional Operator” can come in handy:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/65bc4372a0e4fc3e8f38c0ee57905beb.js"></script>

<p>How does that work? Simple: if <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer</code> is not <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Address</code> property is accessed, and its value is assigned to our local variable. However, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer</code> <em>is</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>, then the whole expression evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>. And that’s what is assigned to the variable.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about the Null Conditional Operator is that you can use it along with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173224.aspx">null-coalescing operator</a> to easily provide a default value, instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/e17d34ba939fb7c472e164010db56377.js"></script>

<h2 id="expression-bodied-methods-and-properties">Expression-bodied methods and properties</h2>

<p>This one is super easy. It’s just a shorter way of writing methods, using the syntax of lambda expressions.</p>

<p>For instance, the two methods do the same thing:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosschults/eeae77f3876f9b692ca667281b5401d0.js"></script>

<p>This feature isn’t restricted to methods, though. It can also be used with properties (only getters) and indexers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It seems clear that Microsoft’s goal with C# 6 was not to add some radical new capabilities to the language.</p>

<p>Rather, they had the intention to enable developers to write code in a cleaner and more concise way. And in my opinion, they succeeded.</p>

<p>You may think that some of the features don’t make that much of a difference, in practice. I beg to differ. C# is often accused of being too verbose. There are situations in which you have to write a decent amount of code to accomplish something that a Ruby programmer or a Python programmer could solve with a one-liner.</p>

<p>And that’s fair enough. Some (most?) of said verbosity is due to C# being a statically typed language, and let me tell you: <strong>I’m glad for that</strong>. I can’t count how many times the compiler saved me by catching my dumb mistakes. If a little bit of verbosity is the price I have to pay for this, so be it.</p>

<p>That being said, the detractors have a point. It is possible to be <em>too</em> verbose. So, any feature that helps me eliminate some of that verbosity and write more concise code is welcome.</p>
