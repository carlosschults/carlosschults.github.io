<p><em>Editorial note: I originally wrote this post for the NDepend blog.  You can <a href="https://blog.ndepend.com/null-evil/">check out the original here, at their site</a>.</em></p>

<p>“Null is evil.” If you’ve been a software developer for any reasonable length of time, I bet you’ve come across that statement several times.</p>

<p>I’d say it’s also very likely that you agree with the sentiment, i.e., that the null reference is a feature our programming languages would be better off without. Even its creator has expressed regret over the null reference, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions">famously calling it his “billion-dollar mistake.”</a></p>

<p>Bashing poor old null tends to get old, so authors don’t do just that. They also offer alternatives. And while I do believe that many of the presented alternatives have their merits, I also think we may have overlooked the best solution for the whole thing.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to examine some of the common alternatives for returning null before making the argument that the best alternative is null itself. Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="null-is-toxic">Null Is Toxic…</h2>

<p>I won’t dwell too much on the whole “null is evil” thing, since a lot has been written about it already. Some examples:</p>

<p><a href="&quot;https://sidburn.github.io/blog/2016/03/20/null-is-evil&quot;&gt;Null is Evil">Null Is Evil</a>
<a href="&quot;http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/11/13/null-has-no-type-but-maybe-has/&quot;&gt;">Null has no type, but Maybe has</a></p>

<p><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12777/are-null-references-really-a-bad-thing">This Stack Overflow answer</a> also has some valuable information.</p>

<h2 id="but-useful-what-are-the-alternatives">…But Useful. What Are the Alternatives?</h2>

<p>Now, I hope we’re on the same page regarding null’s status as a problematic language feature. But toxic or not, null serves some purposes. People use it to represent an absent, invalid, or unknown piece of data, or even to indicate that an error has occurred.</p>

<p>What should they be doing instead?</p>

<h3 id="throw-an-exception">Throw an Exception</h3>

<p>In some situations in which people return null, the reasonable thing to do is to throw an exception. Think of it this way: if a method promises to perform something and fails to do so, it should throw. In other words: when a method fails to fulfill its contract, then it is reasonable to throw.</p>

<p>Of course, you should reserve exceptions for scenarios that are truly exceptional. If a certain situation happens often, then an exception is not the best solution.</p>

<h3 id="null-object-pattern">Null Object Pattern</h3>

<p>Consider the following lines of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">contract</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">repository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">42</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">contract</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">12</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What should happen if there isn’t a contract with ID equals to 42? If the “Find” method returns null, then you’re in for a nasty NullReferenceException. As I’ve said earlier, null makes your code lie. If we were to be really pedantic about it, the method “Find” should be renamed to “FindOrReturnNull”. Too verbose, but more honest.</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern">null object pattern</a> is an attempt to solve this problem. And how does it do that? By creating its own kind of null.</p>

<p>To implement the pattern, we create a new class  ** ** (let’s call it “NullContract”) that represents the case when a contract is missing. We make this new class fulfill the same contract as the original class, but we do nothing in the methods. So, if we imagine that “Contract” implements “IContract”, our NullContract class could look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">NullContract</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">IContract</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// ctor, properties, etc </span>
	
	<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">months</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">{</span>
		<span class="c1">// deliberately does nothing</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By employing the null object pattern you could—theoretically, at least—be sure that you’ll always get an object that fulfills the contract you expect it to honor without blowing up in your face.</p>

<h3 id="maybeoption">Maybe/Option</h3>

<p>Finally, we have a very interesting alternative that is often found in <a href="https://blog.ndepend.com/functional-programming-makes-code-not-oo/">functional programming</a> languages. This alternative is the use of a dedicated type meant to represent the use case of a potentially absent value. For instance, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/options">in F# this is called the option type</a>; Haskell calls it <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.0.0/docs/Data-Maybe.html">Maybe</a>. Starting in version 8, Java introduced the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html">Optional</a> class.</p>

<p>At this time, C# doesn’t offer something along those lines natively.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-null-are-they-any-good">Alternatives to Null: Are They Any Good?</h2>

<p>Having presented the more commonly used alternatives for null, it’s time for the final verdict. Let’s start with the “throw exception” option.</p>

<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>If the caller fails to supply the correct arguments for the function they’re calling, then we could say they’re breaking the function’s contract. Throwing an exception is the correct thing do to in this situation.</p>

<p>The following code is a good example of what  <strong>not</strong>  to do:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="nf">Bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="p">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">&lt;=</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(!</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">IsNullOrWhiteSpace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="c1">// all is fine with the world; let's do what must be done and return some Foo!</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
 
    <span class="c1">// uh-oh! Something wrong with the input parameters. Let's return null. Sounds like a good idea!</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I see code like this all the time in production. Nested ifs are awful. They should have at least used an “and” to fit the whole thing in just one if. But what should really happen is something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="nf">Bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">&lt;=</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="p">||</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ArgumentOutOfRangeException</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="k">nameof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">),</span>
        <span class="s">"The value should be in the range of 1 to 100, inclusive"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
 
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">IsNullOrWhiteSpace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ArgumentException</span><span class="p">(</span>
             <span class="s">"The value should be a valid string."</span><span class="p">,</span>
             <span class="k">nameof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
             <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
 
    <span class="c1">// all is fine with the world; let's do what must be done and return some Foo!</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions/">don’t catch exogenous exceptions</a> that might happen inside your method and return null; instead, just let them bubble up since these type of exceptions represent problems outside of your control. Issues like a failure in the network are problems that you couldn’t have prevented anyway, code-wise.</p>

<h3 id="null-object-pattern-1">Null Object Pattern</h3>

<p>Let’s consider the null object pattern, which I’m certainly not a huge fan of. One problem with this pattern is that you should only use it when the calling code doesn’t care about the outcome of whatever it’s trying to accomplish. Consider again our contract example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">contract</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">repository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">42</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="n">contract</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">12</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This line of code is not “aware” (nor does it care) if the “Contract” variable refers to a valid contract or an instance of NullContract. If it’s a valid contract, it will be extended by 12 months. If it’s not, then nothing will happen. Sometimes, that’s exactly what you want, but not always. In this example, if a contract with ID equals to 42 really was supposed to exist but did not…maybe throwing an exception would work best.</p>

<p>All I’ve said so far is that the null object pattern isn’t well suited for every scenario. This isn’t that bad of a problem; you could say the same about pretty much anything.</p>

<p>My main issue with the null object pattern is that it amounts to little more than creating a new type of null without really solving the problem. You see,  <strong>using the pattern doesn’t prevent you from returning null</strong>. If I consume some method written by a third party that claims to use the pattern, I should be able to assume that whatever it returns is safe for me to deference. But I can’t know for sure. I have three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trust the author of the code;</li>
  <li>Inspect the source code, if possible; or</li>
  <li>Continue to check for null, which completely defeats the purpose of using the pattern.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could argue that these problems aren’t relevant in the context of a single team working with the same codebase. The developers could agree on using the pattern correctly. But if everything amounts to trust and convention at the end of the day, you might as well just agree to never return null and you’d have the same result.</p>

<h3 id="maybeoption-1">Maybe/Option</h3>

<p>Last but not least, what about Maybe/Option types? This is an alternative that’s both elegant and robust, especially in languages such as F# where you’re actually forced, in a sense, to handle both cases by using pattern matching.</p>

<p>But the sad reality is this: while maybe/option types are amazing approaches, they can’t change the fact that null exists and will continue existing. You can’t really stop people from using it, nor can you remove it from all the lines of code people have been writing since the dawn of C#.</p>

<p>So, even though they are great approaches, they still suffer from the problem of being yet another type of null for the developers to deal with.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-for-null-null-itself">The Solution for Null: Null Itself</h2>

<p>Do you know the old saying “When in a hole, stop digging?” For better or worse, null exists. Toxic or not, it’s a feature people use. So maybe the solution for this whole thing is just to fix null.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">kotlin</a> language got it right by having different nullable and non-nullable types and adding all kinds of checks to prevent the developer from doing things that would end badly, like dereferencing a nullable type without checking it for null or assigning a nullable value to a non-nullable variable.</p>

<p>C# gave us the first step in the right direction many years ago with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/">nullable value types</a>. After a long wait, <a href="https://blog.ndepend.com/c-8-0-features-glimpse-future/">reference types will finally get the same benefit with C# 8.0</a>.</p>

<p>The alternative for null is null itself… <strong>when done properly</strong>.</p>

    </h2>

<p><em>Editorial note: I originally wrote this post for the SubMain blog.  You can <a href="https://blog.submain.com/sharpen-saw/">check out the original here, at their site</a>. While you’re there, have a look at CodeIt.Right, their automated code review tool.</em></p>

<p>Are you familiar with the expression “sharpen the saw” in the context of learning and continuous improvement? If you’ve read Stephen Covey’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" title="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, then I’m sure you are. For those unfamiliar with the term, it basically means to engage in practices that will make you better at your craft without necessarily involving the craft itself.</p>

<p>What can you as a tech lead, lead developer, or software architect do to encourage the developers on your team to sharpen their saws? That’s what we’ll to answer with this post. We’ll show you four quick, easy ways your team can improve their skills and deliver more value.</p>

<h2 id="1-sharpening-the-saw-by-reading-create-a-technical-book-club">1. Sharpening the Saw by Reading: Create a Technical Book Club</h2>

<p>Wouldn’t it be awesome to have a team made up of incredibly well-informed people, who are up to date with the relevant, shiny new things and have solid knowledge on the fundamentals of our industry? Yeah, I thought so. And there’s no better way of achieving that than by reading.</p>

<p>What I suggest here is something very simple. Every month, you and your team choose an assigned read for the dev team. On which subject, you ask? Design patterns, concurrency, refactoring, unit testing—I’d say virtually anything is fair game, as long as the developers themselves are interested.</p>

<p>Oh, and before I forget: this probably goes without mentioning, but your company should <em>buy</em> the developers copies of the chosen books. If you feel you can’t afford that, well, I don’t believe you’re going to have a company for very long, I’m afraid.</p>

<p>A less ideal solution would be to buy a copy of the book for one developer. Have them study the book in their spare time and then present their findings to the rest of the team by giving one or more internal talks. Then, select another book and another team member, and have that developer give the internal talk next month.</p>

<p>Now, speaking of internal talks…</p>

<h2 id="2-sharpening-the-saw-by-talking-internal-presentations">2. Sharpening the Saw by Talking: Internal Presentations</h2>

<p>Having the developers deliver internal talks to each other is a great way to spread knowledge throughout the company. For the developers giving the talk, it’s the perfect opportunity to get some hands-on practice with several skills, such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coming up with a subject and doing the necessary research.</li>
  <li>Creating an appealing slide deck.</li>
  <li>Speaking in public, which can be a tough experience for many of us.</li>
  <li>Answering questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on, but in short, they’ll be practicing the general skill of communication. That’s simply priceless. Giving internal talks can be great practice for speaking at conferences, for example.</p>

<p>And what’s on the table for the audience? Obviously, the learning opportunity. But I’ll add that, in the case of internal company talks, the probability of actually putting that knowledge you gained into use is much higher. Since the speakers are actually your coworkers—people who share context with you every day and are aware of the problems and challenges your company is facing—I’d say it’s very likely that they pick a topic that relates to the company.</p>

<h2 id="3-sharpening-the-saw-by-writing-create-and-maintain-an-engineering-blog">3. Sharpening the Saw by Writing: Create and Maintain an Engineering Blog</h2>

<p>When your developers give internal talks, they’re teaching one another, which is fantastic. But what if they could spread this knowledge beyond just your shop, while at the same time improving their writing skills and ability to articulate an argument? What if they could do so while learning about things like content marketing and SEO? And while they’re at it, what if they could demonstrate the technical know-how of your company, positioning it as an expert on its domain area?</p>

<p>There’s a way to do just that, and it’s called blogging.</p>

<p>Start an engineering blog. Decide on the specifics, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What topics should be covered?</li>
  <li>How frequently will you publish?</li>
  <li>Who will the authors be?</li>
</ul>

<p>It would make sense if, at least at the beginning, the developers who are naturally better writers were the blog’s authors. But since the goal here is to learn—to sharpen the saw—the ideal scenario is one in which every developer gets a chance to hone their writing chops.</p>

<h2 id="4-sharpening-the-saw-by-programming-hold-in-company-coding-dojos">4. Sharpening the Saw by Programming: Hold In-Company Coding Dojos</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">coding dojo</a>is a kind of training session for programmers in which they rotate in pairs, working in a collaborative manner on the same problem. The inspiration for the name comes from the martial arts. The goal of a coding dojo isn’t necessarily to solve the problem?but to develop both engineering skills, such as unit testing/TDD, and social skills, such as <a href="https://blog.submain.com/code-review-vs-pair-programming-2/">pair programming.</a></p>

<p>To hold a coding dojo, you’re going to need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Space.</strong> You need a?room large enough to hold from five to 15 people. (Some people say 20 people for a coding dojo is acceptable, but IMHO, this is way too much). Since we’re talking about sharpening your team’s saws, an office or meeting room at your company will probably do.</li>
  <li><strong>A computer</strong>. It could be a desktop computer or laptop; it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s placed on a desk with two chairs, where two people can sit and collaborate comfortably together.</li>
  <li><strong>A projector or a large monitor</strong>. All of the participants need to watch what’s going on at any given moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Snacks and beverages!</strong> A coding dojo should be a bonding experience, and human beings love to connect over food and drink. And <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4414">programmers are human beings</a>, last time I checked. Just be considerate of those with dietary restrictions, and you should be good.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s say you’re actually doing this thing. You’ve assembled the needed gear, and people have shown up at the agreed-upon location. What now?</p>

<p>Well, first things first. You need a problem! But not all programming challenges make a good coding dojo problem. As I said earlier, solving the problem isn’t necessarily the goal—rather, it’s more about practicing engineering skills such as TDD and pair programming. So, writing a compiler from scratch isn’t going to cut it. But implementing a converter to roman numerals might work quite well.</p>

<p>What makes for a good coding dojo problem?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s small, so it’s feasible to solve it in a relatively short time.</li>
  <li>It lends itself well to TDD.</li>
  <li>It’s finite and well-defined. Vague, open-ended challenges won’t do.</li>
  <li>It’s based on a real-world problem, not an abstract one.</li>
  <li>It’s different from the challenges you solve at your day job.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t really need to worry about finding good problems, though. The <a href="http://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/">web’s got your back.?</a>There are <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/">sources</a> for <a href="https://code.joejag.com/coding-dojo/example-katas/">problems</a> out there.</p>

<p>With choosing the problem out of the way, it’s time to pick a language to work on. You don’t need to use the same language you use every day at your job. In fact, it’s nice to use the coding dojo as an opportunity to try out different languages. This can help make things fresh and more challenging. Just don’t forget to have a person who’s knowledgeable about this language around so they can help when the group hits obstacles.</p>

<p>Now,?to start, you’ll need two volunteers: one to be the driver and one to be the co-pilot. These terms come from pair programming. The driver is the person who’s typing, and the co-pilot gives advice and feedback. The remaining people are the audience, at least for now. Ideally, everyone in a coding dojo session should write code.</p>

<p>So, with everyone in their places, the fun begins. The driver starts coding, using TDD’s red-green-refactor cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, they write a failing test.</li>
  <li>Then, they write just the smallest possible amount of code that will make the test pass.</li>
  <li>When the test is passing, it’s time to refactor. Only in this phase?are people in the audience are allowed to speak, giving advice and feedback to help the driver better refactor the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of a?previously-established time period (five to ten?minutes), the driver stops coding and returns to the audience. The copilot becomes the driver, and a new member of the audience becomes the copilot.</p>

<p>This cycle continues until everyone in the room had written code or the allotted time for the session expires—whatever comes first.</p>

<h3 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h3>

<p>As soon as the coding session itself is done, take some time to do a retrospective. Ask the participants about the things they liked and didn’t like about the session, and write it all down. These two lists will serve as a guideline for what to do and not to do in your future coding dojos.</p>
