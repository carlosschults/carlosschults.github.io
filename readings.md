The purpose of this page is to keep track of the interesting things that I had read. These things will be mostly blog posts,
but the list might include books, academic papers, and other forms of content at some point.

I copied the idea from [here](https://blog.royalsloth.eu/interesting-articles/).

## Management
- <a href="https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">"Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule", by Paul Graham</a>: A 15-years old article that still rings as true today. If you're a manager and can't understand why your developers hate meetings, impromptu calls and other distractions, make yourself—and themselves—a favor and read this.

## Programming
- <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/">"The Grug Brained Developer"</a>: a humorous guide about software development learnings, collected over the author's career. In a way, it's a warning against unnecessary complexity.

## Writing
- <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/06/a-blogging-style-guide/">"A blogging style guide", by Robert Heaton</a>: it's exactly what it sounds like, a collection of tips to improve one's writing as a blog author.
- <a href="https://robertheaton.com/a-blogging-style-guide-vol-2/">"A blogging style guide vol. 2", by Robert Heaton</a>: a sequel to the above.
