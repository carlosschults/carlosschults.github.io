## Hi. I'm Carlos.

![Picture by Marcio Sichieri](/img/foto.jpg)

Welcome to my blog! My name is Carlos Schults. I'm a 32 years old software engineer and technical writer based in Brazil. My current full-time job is at [AmbevTech](https://www.ambevtech.com.br/).

While C# is the language I'm most experienced with, I worked with several technologies during my career, including Java, Python, PHP, and even VB.NET.

Sporadically, I work as a freelancer technical author. Most of my work on that space has been done in partnership with  [Hit Subscribe](https://hitsubscribe.com), having written more than 200 posts for clients such as NDepend, NCrunch, Submain, Testim.io, TechBeacon, and many more.

I'm a firm believer in the thesis that if you really want to learn something, you have to teach it. In a nutshell, this blog exists so I can share helpful tidbits on software development in the hope they help someone else and in the hope _I_ learn more in the process.
