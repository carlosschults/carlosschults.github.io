## Hi. I'm Carlos.

Welcome to my blog! My name is Carlos Schults, a software engineer and technical writer based in Brazil. 

While C# is the language I'm most experienced with, I worked with several technologies during my career, including Java, Python, PHP, and even VB.NET. Despite having
experience with frontend development (particularly with React as a framework and Typescript as a language), I specialize in backend software development.

Sporadically, I work as a freelancer technical author. Most of my work on that space has been done in partnership with  [Hit Subscribe](https://hitsubscribe.com), having written more than 200 posts for clients such as NDepend, NCrunch, Submain, Testim.io, TechBeacon, and many more.

I'm a firm believer in the thesis that if you really want to learn something, you have to teach it. In a nutshell, this blog exists so I can share helpful tidbits on software development in the hope they help someone else and in the hope _I_ learn more in the process.

## Open Invite

If you'd like to talk to me about software development or technology in general, then I want to talk to you. Here are some ways we can connect:

- If you're a junior developer looking for mentorship, I can help you.
- Found a typo or any type of mistake in one of my posts? Or even just disagree with something I've written? Let me know!
- Do you want to review a piece of writing (e.g., a blog post) before you publish? I'd be happy to help.
- If you have recommendations for interesting books, posts, articles, or podcasts, please send them my way!
- Or anything, really. Feel free to contact me at:

I look forward to hearing from you!
